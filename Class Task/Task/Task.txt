loops :

1) Write a js code to print sum of array element

2) Write a js code the sum of digit is equal to product of digits for a given number
   eg = 144
      1+4+4 = 9
      1*4*4 = 16

      sum == mul is a strong number or not a strong number

  
3) Using loops find the sum of nested arrays and print them
     eg = [[10,20,10,50],[0,10,30,40],[10,10,10,10]]

4)
