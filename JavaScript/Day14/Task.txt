Ques 1 : Basic Calculator - Adding Numbers (using Named functions)
--------
Description -
    Imagine you're building a simple web-based calculator. When a user inputs two numbers and clicks "Add", you need a reliable way to perform this basic arithmetic operation. A named     function is perfect for this because adding numbers is a common, repeatable task.

Steps -
    - Create a named function called addTwoNumbers.

    - It should accept two inputs: num1 and num2.

    - Inside the function, add num1 and num2.

    - The function should give back (return) the calculated sum.

    - Call the function with different pairs of numbers to test it.

Test Cases -

    Sample input : num1 = 3, num2 = 5
    Sample output : 3 + 5 = 8

    Sample input : num1 = 3, num2 = 5
    Sample output : 3 + 5 = 8

Ques 2 :  Personalized Greeting Message
--------
Description :
    When a user logs into their account (e.g., on a social media site, an online store, or a news portal), you want to greet them by name. Instead of writing console.log("Hello,     [username]! Welcome back!"); everywhere, a function makes this greeting consistent and easy to update.

Steps :

    - Create a named function called createWelcomeMessage.

    - It should accept one object: user.

    - Inside the function, combine a fixed greeting phrase with the object properties.

    - The function should return the complete greeting string.

    - Call the function with different user objects.

Test Cases :

    Sample Input : user object : name : "Ravindra", address : "Ameerpet Hyderabad", institute : "Naresh i technologies", batch : "Java 51"
    Sample Output: Hello, Ravindra! Welcome to our platform!
           

    Sample Input : Guest
    Sample Output: Hello, Guest! Welcome to our platform!

Ques 3 : Merge two arrays
--------
Description :
   Write a JavaScript program to merge two arrays by removing duplicate values.
Steps:

    - Create a named function called mergeArrays.

    - It should accept two inputs: Array 1 (Array) and Array 2 (Array).

    - First, check if array1.length and array2.length is less than or equal to 0. If so, return false immediately.

    - After checking merged array, if it has the duplicate elements then remove the duplicate elements and print the array

Test Cases :

    Sample Input : arr1 [1,2,3,4], arr2 [2,3,4,5,6]
    Sample Output: [1,5,6]
