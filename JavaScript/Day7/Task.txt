Que 1 :
---------
Write a 'JavaScript' program to store 10 elements in array and print them on a console take the inputs from the user.
Que 2 :
--------
Write a 'JavaScript' program to sort the numbers array using selection sort technique without using predefined function.

The selection sort technique is the normal sorting technique used to sort the array by comparing the elements and swapping them.
Sample Input :
let numbers = [45, 3, 25, 78, 12];
Sample output :
Ascending Order: [3, 12, 25, 45, 78]
Descending Order: [78, 45, 25, 12, 3]
Que 3 :
--------
Write a 'JavaScript' program to Separate Strings and Numbers and print array using the forEach method.

The original array is containing both numbers and strings.
define two empty arrays: numbers and strings
use the .forEach() method to iterate through mixedArray
check the type of the element using typeof operator and store the respective type in the array.
if the type is string add the element into the string array else add it into the numbers array.
Sample input :
let mixedArray = [12, "apple", 45, "banana", "cherry", 78, "orange"];

sample output :
Numbers: [12, 45, 78]
Strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange"]

Que 4 :
-------
Write a 'JavaScript' program to Filter Even and Odd Numbers from array in separate arrays.

The original array contains only the numeric values.
your task is to find whether the array element is even or add
Take 2 separate arrays : evenArr and oddArr.
if the element is even add it into the evenArr else add it into the oddArr.
Sample input :
Numbers Array : let orgArray = [3, 12, 25, 45, 78]
Sample Output :
Even Array = [12, 78]
Odd Array = [3, 25, 45,]

Que 5:
--------
Write a 'JavaScript' program to print Sum of All array elements.

your task is to take the numbers array and the elements from the user using the prompt() function.
you have to find and print the sum of the all array elements.
sample input:
let numbers = [45, 3, 25, 78, 12];

Sample output :
The sum of array elements is : 163
